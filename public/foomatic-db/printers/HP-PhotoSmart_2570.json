The HPLIP project provides printing\n   support for over 3000 printer models, including Deskjet,\n   Officejet, Photosmart, PSC (Print, Scan, Copy), Business Inkjet, Envy,\n   NeverStop, Smart Tank, Tango, DesignJet,\n   (Color) LaserJet, Mopier, Edgeline MFP, and LaserJet MFP.<P>\n\n   Note that most HP models are supported, but a few are not. See\n   <a\n   href=\"https://developers.hp.com/hp-linux-imaging-and-printing/supported_devices/index\">Supported\n   Devices</a> at the HPLIP website for more\n   information.<P>\n\n   HPLIP is free, open source software distributed under the MIT, BSD,\n   and GPL licenses. HP does not provide formal consumer or commercial\n   support for this software.<P>\n\n   HPLIP contains two flavors of the printer driver. The default\n   driver is the CUPS Raster driver \"hpcups\" and as alternative the\n   older IJS-based HPIJS driver is still available, but its development and\n   support has been discontinued. In addition there\n   are ready-made PPD files for all supported PostScript printers, so\n   that they get used in PostScript mode. HPLIP ships updated PPD\n   files for all HP printers and both driver flavors. Therefore we do\n   not provide PPD files here. For non-HP printers which work with\n   HPIJS we provide PPDs via the driver entries \"<a\n   href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs-pcl3\">hpijs-pcl3</a>\",\n   \"<a\n   href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs-pcl5e\">hpijs-pcl5e</a>\",\n   \"<a\n   href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs-pcl5c\">hpijs-pcl5c</a>\".<P>",

  "notes": "It has ports on the side for inserting SmartMedia and CompactFlash\n    digital \"film\" and has an LCD panel that lets you select\n    pictures from the \"film\" to print, so one can use the\n    device as a digital photo lab without PC.<p>\n\n    For basic printing functionality use the <a href=\"\n    http://hplipopensource.com/\">HPIJS driver </a>. \n    For advanced functionality such as printer status, maintenance \n    features, and photo card unload use the <a href=\"\n    http://hplipopensource.com/\">HPLIP driver</a> \n    (which includes HPIJS). <p>\n    Best output quality reachable with the HPLIP\n    driver, especially the 1200-dpi high resolution mode gives\n    excellent photo quality.<p>\n\n    When used with HP's HPLIP driver, this printer\n    auto-detects the paper type and does appropriate dithering and\n    colour adjustment internally, controlled by the hardware. So even\n    when Ghostscript with the HPLIP driver only renders\n    the image with 300 or 600 dpi, the 2400x1200 dpi are used for the\n    internal dithering. So if you insert photo paper, the printer will\n    print in its highest quality, no paper type choice in the\n    driver's options is needed. There is also a special high\n    resolution mode where the image is rendered in 1200 dpi, without\n    paper detection, intended for photo paper only.<p>\n\n    In addition to the PhotoSmart P1215 this printer has a duplex unit\n    (supported by the HPLIP, \"cdj970\", and\n    \"pcl3\" drivers).<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Refill: 1 black, 1 color cartridge<p>"
