Grant\n    Taylor has implemented a workaround.  On the driver's download\n    page (it is here on OpenPrinting, Samsung does not provide\n    this driver any more) you will find a patch and an already fixed\n    version.<p>\n\n    And <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/ghostscript-8.x/drivers/gdi/\">here</a>\n    you get the version for GPL/AFPL Ghostscript 8.x, also with\n    Grant's fixes. In ESP Ghostscript 8.x this driver is already\n    included. If you want to add it to your Ghostscript, put the\n    <tt>gdevgdi.c</tt> file into the\n    <tt>src/</tt> subdirectory of the Ghostscript source\n    package, append <tt>gdevgdi-gdi.mak</tt> to\n    <tt>src/contrib.mak</tt>, and add\n    \"<tt>$(DD)gdi.dev</tt>\" to one of the\n    \"<tt>DEVICE_DEVS...</tt>\" lines of\n    <tt>src/Makefile.in</tt>. Then compile as\n    ususal.<p>\n\n    Here is a <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/samsung-gdi/gpl-gs-8.54-samsunggdi.patch\">patch\n    to add the \"gdi\" driver to GPL Ghostscript 8.54</a>. Please\n    test it and report on our Samsung forum. Thanks to MJ Ray (mjr at\n    phonecoop dot coop) for this contribution.<p>\n\n    This Foomatic entry gives access to all options which the Windows\n    driver provides for Samsung's GDI printers. As this was not\n    forseen by the original Ghostscript driver from Samsung, a hack\n    was applied in this Foomatic entry. The driver does not need to be\n    patched for that.<p>\n\n    If you are using MagicFilter 1.2, you can use <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/samsung-gdi/gdi-filter.gz\">this\n    filter</a> with the driver (developed on Debian Potato,\n    contributed by Felix E. Klee, felix dot klee at inka dot de). To\n    install you have to uncompress it and to copy it into your\n    MagicFilter directory (<tt>/etc/magicfilter</tt> on\n    Debian). This file does not work with newer versions of\n    MagicFilter.",

If you have such a printer, you need to\n    download and use SpliX. Moreover you will find documentation\n    about this proprietary language.<p>\n\n    Note that only SPL2 (monochrome) and SPLc (color) printers are\n    currently supported! However we are looking for people who have an\n    SPL 1 printer to implement this SPL version as soon as\n    possible.<p>\n\n    Not all SPL2 and SPLc printers are tested with this driver. Please\n    report your experience here.<p>\n\n    As the PPD files are contained in the driver package we will not\n    provide PPD files here on OpenPrinting.<p>\n\n    <b>Important:</b> For color printers SpliX needs color\n    profiles from the printer's manufacturer, otherwise it will refuse\n    to print. Please see the instructions in the INSTALL file of the\n    driver's source package. Alternatively, you can use the \"<a\n    href=\"/driver/foo2qpdl\">foo2qpdl</a>\" driver for the\n    color printers. That driver also prints without installed color\n    profiles.<p>\n\n    This driver is a pure printer driver. The scanning functionality\n    of multi-function devices is not supported.<p>\n\n    Note that the original author of the driver, Aurelien Croc, doe\n    not have time any more to do further development and maintenance\n    on the driver.  Currently user-supplied patches and fixes are\n    applied by Till Kamppeter to the Subversion repository of the\n    driver and there were no releases and web site updates in the last\n    two years. If you are packaging the driver for a Linux\n    distribution, it is highly recommended to use a Subversion\n    snapshot and not the 2.0.0 release.<p>",

The installation is quick and flawlessly. You can use CUPS or LPRng as backend. The installer also offers to install a printer management GUI and to integrate that with KDE/Gnome. (This GUI seems to be able to manage other CUPS printers, too; I didn't try that, however.)<p>\n\nThe driver package also contains a set of .ppd files among which is one for the ML-1610, appearently for PS Level 3.<p>\n\nAs the installation went smooth and the printer works fine, I'm setting the status to \"Perfectly\".<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Single toner cartridge / 2,000 pages (ships with 1,000-page starter toner cartridge)<p>"
