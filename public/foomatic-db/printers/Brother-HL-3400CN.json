Generally, for Postscript\n    printers, you will not need a driver, as all applications produce\n    PostScript. For the printing system getting access to the\n    printer-specific features the manufacturer supplies a PPD file for\n    every PostScript printer. Use this PPD file instead of a\n    Foomatic-generated one to get all functionality of your PostScript\n    printer working. The files provided by Foomatic are generic files\n    which contain only some standard options, use them only if you do\n    not find an appropriate PPD for your printer.<p>\n\n    One can make use of all functionality which the PostScript\n    printers have under Windows/MacOS when one uses the PPD file\n    coming with the printer, downloaded from <a\n    href=\"/download/PPD/\">here on OpenPrinting</a>, from the\n    manufacturer's home page, or from <a\n    href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/printerdrivers/winppd.html\">Adobe's</a>\n    web site (do \"<tt>unzip -L [filename].EXE</tt>\" to get the\n    PPD files). If there are several different PPD files for your\n    printer model and none dedicated for Linux or Unix, the PPD for\n    Windows NT works best in most cases.<p>\n\n    CUPS and PPR support PPD files directly, LPD/GNUlpr/LPRng, PDQ,\n    CPS, and spooler-less users can set up their printers with\n    <tt>foomatic-rip</tt> as they would set up a printer\n    with a Foomatic PPD file. <tt>foomatic-rip</tt> works\n    as well with manufacturer-supplied PostScript PPD files. This way\n    all PostScript printers work perfectly under GNU/Linux or other\n    free operating systems. Ghostscript is not needed for them. See\n    also our <a href=\"ppd-doc.html\">PPD documentation\n    page</a> for instructions.<p>\n\n    See the tutorial chapter \"<a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/kpfeifle/LinuxKongress2002/Tutorial/III.PostScript-and-PPDs/III.PostScript-and-PPDs.html\">Some\n    Theoretical Background: CUPS, PPDs, PostScript, and\n    Ghostscript</a>\" (<a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/kpfeifle/LinuxKongress2002/Tutorial/III.PostScript-and-PPDs/III.PostScript-and-PPDs.pdf\">PDF</a>)\n    for detailed information about PostScript and PPD files.<p>",

It comes as a part of HPLIP, HP Linux\n   Imaging and Printing. HPLIP is a complete driver suite which also\n   includes scanning, copying, and fax drivers for multi-function\n   devices and also the printer maintenance and management utility\n   hp-toolbox.<P>\n\n   The HPIJS driver is only one of the two flavors of HP's printer\n   driver. HP has recently added the CUPS Raster driver hpcups and\n   uses this driver by default currently. HPIJS is still included in\n   HPLIP, but more for backward compatibility.<P>\n\n   HP provides PPD files for all their supported printers and both\n   driver flavors.<P>\n\n   Many non-HP color printers are compatible to HP printers as they\n   use the same page description language, PCL 5c. This language was\n   introduced with the HP Color LaserJet 5 printer. Many PostScript\n   printers also understand PCL 5c which can be used as alternative\n   language if the printer has not enough memory to render\n   PostScript. This driver entry generates PPD files to use HPIJS with\n   PCL 5c color laser printers which are not from HP, and so allows\n   the use of this high-quality printer driver with a wide range of\n   printers.<P>\n\n   Double-sided printing and tray selection is supported, but tray numbers\n   may be different.<P>",

This entry for the \"pxlcolor\" driver\n    lists only color printers. See the \"<a href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=pxlmono\">pxlmono</a>\" driver entry\n    for monochrome printers.<p>\n\n    Due to a bug in Ghostscript Duplex does not work with the\n    \"pxlmono\" and the \"pxlcolor\" drivers. Here is a <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/ghostscript-pxl-patches/duplex.patch\">patch</a>\n    for GPL Ghostscript 8.63. This patch is needed so that the Duplex\n    option of the PPDs from this site works. Setting Duplex with PJL\n    commands does not work.<p>\n\n    The resolution must be given both with the \"-r\" option\n    on the command line of Ghostscript and as PJL command. Here is a\n    <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/ghostscript-pxl-patches/resolution.patch\">patch</a>\n    for GPL Ghostscript 8.63 so that giving the PJL commands is not\n    necessary any more. This patch is needed for the resolution option\n    of the PPDs of this site to work.<p>\n\n    Another Ghostscript bug in the driver broke paper input tray\n    selection. This <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/ghostscript-pxl-patches/inputslot.patch\">patch</a>\n    for GPL Ghostscript 8.63 fixes the problem and allows to set the\n    input tray with the \"-dMediaPosition=X\" commmand line\n    option for Ghostscript. \"X\" is an integer number which\n    depends on the printer model and tray. For HP \"0\" is\n    usually the printer default, \"1\" automatic selection,\n    \"2\" manual feed, \"4\" the upper, and\n    \"5\" the lower tray. Note that for PCL 5/5e these numbers\n    are different. This patch is required so that tray selection with\n    the PPDs of this site works.<p>\n\n    GPL Ghostscript 8.63 comes with a CUPS filter (\"pstopxl\") and 2\n    PPD files for the \"pxlmono\" and \"pxlcolor\" drivers. Note that you\n    will need all the three patches mentioned here to make the options\n    in the PPD files actually work. With this <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/ghostscript-cups-patches/pstopxl-pdf-input.patch\">patch</a>\n    the filter and the PPDs will be made ready for <a\n    href=\"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/OpenPrinting/PDF_as_Standard_Print_Job_Format\">PDF\n    input</a>.<p>\n\n    The patches are all applied to GPL Ghostscript from version 8.64\n    on, so they are not needed any more with this version or later\n    versions of Ghostscript.<p>",
