Generally, for Postscript\n    printers, you will not need a driver, as all applications produce\n    PostScript. For the printing system getting access to the\n    printer-specific features the manufacturer supplies a PPD file for\n    every PostScript printer. Use this PPD file instead of a\n    Foomatic-generated one to get all functionality of your PostScript\n    printer working. The files provided by Foomatic are generic files\n    which contain only some standard options, use them only if you do\n    not find an appropriate PPD for your printer.<p>\n\n    One can make use of all functionality which the PostScript\n    printers have under Windows/MacOS when one uses the PPD file\n    coming with the printer, downloaded from <a\n    href=\"/download/PPD/\">here on OpenPrinting</a>, from the\n    manufacturer's home page, or from <a\n    href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/printerdrivers/winppd.html\">Adobe's</a>\n    web site (do \"<tt>unzip -L [filename].EXE</tt>\" to get the\n    PPD files). If there are several different PPD files for your\n    printer model and none dedicated for Linux or Unix, the PPD for\n    Windows NT works best in most cases.<p>\n\n    CUPS and PPR support PPD files directly, LPD/GNUlpr/LPRng, PDQ,\n    CPS, and spooler-less users can set up their printers with\n    <tt>foomatic-rip</tt> as they would set up a printer\n    with a Foomatic PPD file. <tt>foomatic-rip</tt> works\n    as well with manufacturer-supplied PostScript PPD files. This way\n    all PostScript printers work perfectly under GNU/Linux or other\n    free operating systems. Ghostscript is not needed for them. See\n    also our <a href=\"ppd-doc.html\">PPD documentation\n    page</a> for instructions.<p>\n\n    See the tutorial chapter \"<a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/kpfeifle/LinuxKongress2002/Tutorial/III.PostScript-and-PPDs/III.PostScript-and-PPDs.html\">Some\n    Theoretical Background: CUPS, PPDs, PostScript, and\n    Ghostscript</a>\" (<a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/kpfeifle/LinuxKongress2002/Tutorial/III.PostScript-and-PPDs/III.PostScript-and-PPDs.pdf\">PDF</a>)\n    for detailed information about PostScript and PPD files.<p>",

It comes as a part of HPLIP, HP Linux\n   Imaging and Printing. HPLIP is a complete driver suite which also\n   includes scanning, copying, and fax drivers for multi-function\n   devices and also the printer maintenance and management utility\n   hp-toolbox.<P>\n\n   The HPIJS driver is only one of the two flavors of HP's printer\n   driver. HP has recently added the CUPS Raster driver hpcups and\n   uses this driver by default currently. HPIJS is still included in\n   HPLIP, but more for backward compatibility.<P>\n\n   HP provides PPD files for all their supported printers and both\n   driver flavors.<P>\n\n   Many non-HP printers are compatible to HP printers as they use the\n   same page description language, PCL 5e. This language was\n   introduced with the HP LaserJet 4 and it is probably the most used\n   standard page description language after PostScript. Even most of\n   the PostScript printers understand PCL 5e which can be used as\n   alternative language if the printer has not enough memory to render\n   PostScript. This driver entry generates PPD files to use HPIJS with\n   PCL 5e laser printers which are not from HP, and so allows the use\n   of this high-quality printer driver with a wide range of\n   printers.<P>\n\n   Double-sided printing and tray selection is supported, but tray numbers\n   may be different.<P>",

If you have such a printer, you need to\n    download and use SpliX. Moreover you will find documentation\n    about this proprietary language.<p>\n\n    Note that only SPL2 (monochrome) and SPLc (color) printers are\n    currently supported! However we are looking for people who have an\n    SPL 1 printer to implement this SPL version as soon as\n    possible.<p>\n\n    Not all SPL2 and SPLc printers are tested with this driver. Please\n    report your experience here.<p>\n\n    As the PPD files are contained in the driver package we will not\n    provide PPD files here on OpenPrinting.<p>\n\n    <b>Important:</b> For color printers SpliX needs color\n    profiles from the printer's manufacturer, otherwise it will refuse\n    to print. Please see the instructions in the INSTALL file of the\n    driver's source package. Alternatively, you can use the \"<a\n    href=\"/driver/foo2qpdl\">foo2qpdl</a>\" driver for the\n    color printers. That driver also prints without installed color\n    profiles.<p>\n\n    This driver is a pure printer driver. The scanning functionality\n    of multi-function devices is not supported.<p>\n\n    Note that the original author of the driver, Aurelien Croc, doe\n    not have time any more to do further development and maintenance\n    on the driver.  Currently user-supplied patches and fixes are\n    applied by Till Kamppeter to the Subversion repository of the\n    driver and there were no releases and web site updates in the last\n    two years. If you are packaging the driver for a Linux\n    distribution, it is highly recommended to use a Subversion\n    snapshot and not the 2.0.0 release.<p>",
