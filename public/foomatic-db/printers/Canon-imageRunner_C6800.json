Generally, for Postscript\n    printers, you will not need a driver, as all applications produce\n    PostScript. For the printing system getting access to the\n    printer-specific features the manufacturer supplies a PPD file for\n    every PostScript printer. Use this PPD file instead of a\n    Foomatic-generated one to get all functionality of your PostScript\n    printer working. The files provided by Foomatic are generic files\n    which contain only some standard options, use them only if you do\n    not find an appropriate PPD for your printer.<p>\n\n    One can make use of all functionality which the PostScript\n    printers have under Windows/MacOS when one uses the PPD file\n    coming with the printer, downloaded from <a\n    href=\"/download/PPD/\">here on OpenPrinting</a>, from the\n    manufacturer's home page, or from <a\n    href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/printerdrivers/winppd.html\">Adobe's</a>\n    web site (do \"<tt>unzip -L [filename].EXE</tt>\" to get the\n    PPD files). If there are several different PPD files for your\n    printer model and none dedicated for Linux or Unix, the PPD for\n    Windows NT works best in most cases.<p>\n\n    CUPS and PPR support PPD files directly, LPD/GNUlpr/LPRng, PDQ,\n    CPS, and spooler-less users can set up their printers with\n    <tt>foomatic-rip</tt> as they would set up a printer\n    with a Foomatic PPD file. <tt>foomatic-rip</tt> works\n    as well with manufacturer-supplied PostScript PPD files. This way\n    all PostScript printers work perfectly under GNU/Linux or other\n    free operating systems. Ghostscript is not needed for them. See\n    also our <a href=\"ppd-doc.html\">PPD documentation\n    page</a> for instructions.<p>\n\n    See the tutorial chapter \"<a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/kpfeifle/LinuxKongress2002/Tutorial/III.PostScript-and-PPDs/III.PostScript-and-PPDs.html\">Some\n    Theoretical Background: CUPS, PPDs, PostScript, and\n    Ghostscript</a>\" (<a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/kpfeifle/LinuxKongress2002/Tutorial/III.PostScript-and-PPDs/III.PostScript-and-PPDs.pdf\">PDF</a>)\n    for detailed information about PostScript and PPD files.<p>",

It comes as a part of HPLIP, HP Linux\n   Imaging and Printing. HPLIP is a complete driver suite which also\n   includes scanning, copying, and fax drivers for multi-function\n   devices and also the printer maintenance and management utility\n   hp-toolbox.<P>\n\n   The HPIJS driver is only one of the two flavors of HP's printer\n   driver. HP has recently added the CUPS Raster driver hpcups and\n   uses this driver by default currently. HPIJS is still included in\n   HPLIP, but more for backward compatibility.<P>\n\n   HP provides PPD files for all their supported printers and both\n   driver flavors.<P>\n\n   Many non-HP color printers are compatible to HP printers as they\n   use the same page description language, PCL 5c. This language was\n   introduced with the HP Color LaserJet 5 printer. Many PostScript\n   printers also understand PCL 5c which can be used as alternative\n   language if the printer has not enough memory to render\n   PostScript. This driver entry generates PPD files to use HPIJS with\n   PCL 5c color laser printers which are not from HP, and so allows\n   the use of this high-quality printer driver with a wide range of\n   printers.<P>\n\n   Double-sided printing and tray selection is supported, but tray numbers\n   may be different.<P>",
