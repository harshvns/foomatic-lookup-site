Please follow the instructions comming with the driver.\n\n\t<p>\n\n\tTill Kamppeter has tested this driver on the LaserJet 1022 and\n        there the driver works very well. It is faster and more\n        reliable then the HPIJS driver for the PCL 5e mode of this\n        model.\n\n\t<p>\n\n\tPPD files (and the Foomatic XML files to generate them) come\n\twith the driver, therefore we do not supply PPDs here on the\n\tOpenPrinting site.",

  "notes": "The magicolor 2430 DL is a network color laser printer with a\n\t2005 street price of $500 USD. This printer is supported by a\n\tfree CUPS driver supplied by Konica Minolta and also by the\n\t\"foo2zjs\" free software printer driver.\n\n\tNote that the older Minolta magicolor 2430 DL and the newer\n\tKonica Minolta magicolor 2430 DL are not 100% equal. So it is not\n\tsure whether the Minolta magicolor 2430 DL perhaps also works with\n\tthe driver from Konica Minolta.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: <br>\n\t\tToner Black (4500 prints) - $79<br>\n\t\tToner Yellow (4500 prints) - $119<br>\n\t\tToner Magenta (4500 prints) - $119<br>\n\t\tToner Cyan (4500 prints) - $119<br>\n\t\tDrum Catridge (45000 prints) - $149<br> Part numbers: 1710587-004, \n\t    1710587-005, \n\t    1710587-006, \n\t    1710587-007, \n\t    1710591-001<p>"
