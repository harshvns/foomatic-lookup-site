Its\n    primary goal is uncompromising quality.  Epson Stylus printers in\n    particular are supported in all resolutions and modes, and the\n    latest printers are capable of producing prints that rival\n    photographic prints in quality. This package also offers much\n    faster printing for high quality text and presentation graphics\n    when required.<p>\n\n    Gutenprint is the successor of Gimp-Print, it was renamed with\n    the change from version 4.x to 5.x. All printers which worked with\n    Gimp-Print before, work also (and hopefully better) with\n    Gutenprint.<p>\n\n    The actual printer drivers are in the Gutenprint library. To give\n    access to them Gutenprint has various interfaces:<p>\n\n    <ol>\n\n    <li><em>Plug-in for the GIMP</em>: This plug-in\n    provides a printing dialog for the GIMP to print images directly,\n    and graphical controls to adjust the rich set of options of the\n    Gutenprint drivers. The possibility to integrate a PPD file and to\n    print PostScript allows to use the plug-in also with Ghostscript\n    drivers other than Gutenprint or on PostScript printers.<p>\n\n    <li><em>Native CUPS driver</em>: This interface\n    makes it possible to set up print queues under CUPS so that one\n    can print from any application or from the command line. As it\n    integrates directlty into the CUPS filtering system it is easy to\n    set up in any CUPS 1.1.x or CUPS 1.2.x version without need of any\n    additional software. With Foomatic it is even possible to use this\n    native CUPS driver with other spoolers than CUPS.<p>\n\n    <li><em>Ghostscript IJS plug-in</em>: This is a\n    way to use Gutenprint as a Ghostscript driver without necessity of\n    patching and recompiling Ghostscript. It uses the <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/ijs/\">IJS</a>\n    plug-in interface as also <a\n    href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs\">HPIJS</a>\n    from HP or <a\n    href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/epsonepl/\">the\n    drivers for the Epson EPL-....L series</a> do. IJS drivers\n    can be used with any IJS-enabled Ghostscript as ESP Ghostscript\n    7.x or newer, GNU Ghostscript 6.53 or newer, APFL Ghostscript 7.04\n    or newer. With the Foomatic data coming with Gutenprint and the\n    current <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/foomatic.html\">Foomatic</a>\n    packages PPD files for use with all printing systems (CUPS, LPRng,\n    LPD, GNUlpr, PPR, PDQ, CPS, spooler-less printing) can be\n    generated. Print queues set up with these PPD files and\n    <tt>foomatic-rip</tt> give full access to all options\n    of the Gutenprint driver.<p>\n\n    </ol>\n\n    The Gutenprint package already ships with all needed PPD files for\n    CUPS and data files for Foomatic. Therefore we do not provide PPD\n    files for download here.<p>\n\n    If you got Gutenprint with your operating system distribution, use\n    the printer setup program coming with your distribution. Otherwise\n    it is recommended to use the CUPS driver if you use CUPS as your\n    printing system or the IJS driver if you use another\n    spooler.<p>\n\n    <b>IMPORTANT: Always use the Foomatic data and/or\n    PPD files of the Gutenprint version which you are actually using!\n    Remove and re-create your print queues after every update of\n    Gutenprint. If you are using the Gutenprint package of your Linux\n    distribution, it is possible that the Foomatic data and/or the PPD\n    files can be in separate packages. Make sure you install them and\n    that they are of the version corresponding to your Gutenprint\n    package.</b><p>\n\n    The information currently here corresponds to driver version\n    5.2.7. If you use another version, have a look in the\n    documentation coming with your Gutenprint package. If you have\n    still a 4.x version of Gimp-Print, it is highly recommended to\n    upgrade at least to Gutenprint 5.0.x.<p>\n\n    The driver package which is available for download here on this\n    site only contains the CUPS driver and the utilities (escputil,\n    cups-calibrate), it does not contain the IJS driver and the GIMP\n    plug-in.<p>",

This entry for the \"pxlmono\" driver\n    lists only monochrome printers. See the \"<a href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=pxlcolor\">pxlcolor</a>\" driver entry\n    for color printers.<p>\n\n    Due to a bug in Ghostscript Duplex does not work with the\n    \"pxlmono\" and the \"pxlcolor\" drivers. Here is a <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/ghostscript-pxl-patches/duplex.patch\">patch</a>\n    for GPL Ghostscript 8.63. This patch is needed so that the Duplex\n    option of the PPDs from this site works. Setting Duplex with PJL\n    commands does not work.<p>\n\n    The resolution must be given both with the \"-r\" option\n    on the command line of Ghostscript and as PJL command. Here is a\n    <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/ghostscript-pxl-patches/resolution.patch\">patch</a>\n    for GPL Ghostscript 8.63 so that giving the PJL commands is not\n    necessary any more. This patch is needed for the resolution option\n    of the PPDs of this site to work.<p>\n\n    Another Ghostscript bug in the driver broke paper input tray\n    selection. This <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/ghostscript-pxl-patches/inputslot.patch\">patch</a>\n    for GPL Ghostscript 8.63 fixes the problem and allows to set the\n    input tray with the \"-dMediaPosition=X\" commmand line\n    option for Ghostscript. \"X\" is an integer number which\n    depends on the printer model and tray. For HP \"0\" is\n    usually the printer default, \"1\" automatic selection,\n    \"2\" manual feed, \"4\" the upper, and\n    \"5\" the lower tray. Note that for PCL 5/5e these numbers\n    are different. This patch is required so that tray selection with\n    the PPDs of this site works.<p>\n\n    GPL Ghostscript 8.63 comes with a CUPS filter (\"pstopxl\") and 2\n    PPD files for the \"pxlmono\" and \"pxlcolor\" drivers. Note that you\n    will need all the three patches mentioned here to make the options\n    in the PPD files actually work. With this <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/ghostscript-cups-patches/pstopxl-pdf-input.patch\">patch</a>\n    the filter and the PPDs will be made ready for <a\n    href=\"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/OpenPrinting/PDF_as_Standard_Print_Job_Format\">PDF\n    input</a>.<p>\n\n    The patches are all applied to GPL Ghostscript from version 8.64\n    on, so they are not needed any more with this version or later\n    versions of Ghostscript.<p>",
