Applications usually produce PostScript level 2 or 3,\n    sometimes also PDF. None of these formats can be printed by the\n    old PostScript level 1 printers. Fortunately, Ghostscript can\n    convert all these data formats into PostScript level 1 and so\n    these printers can also print.<p>\n\n    Note that printing with manufacturer-supplied PPDs will not work\n    with PostScript level 1 printers.<p>",

There is still a\n    SourceForge project where version 0.9.2 was added as the last\n    release in September 2004.<p>\n\n    To keep this repository of technology, especially its excellent\n    XML-data-driven concept and also the knowledge about the more than\n    450 printers Omni supported, in mind of users and driver\n    developers, we have added this entry now.<p>\n\n    We do not recommend to use Omni in production environments and\n    also do not develop on or maintain the project. Volunteers for\n    continuing this development are welcome. And anyway, this code is\n    free software and so it can help you developing your own\n    drivers.<p></b>\n\n    <b>Thanks to IBM and Mark Hamzy, Pete Zannucci, and Mark\n    VanderWiele for working out this great concept!</b><p>\n\n    IBM's free Ghostscript driver project to support arround 450\n    printers, based on the knowledge about these printers of OS/2\n    times. The drivers itself are in dynamic libraries and nearly all\n    printer information they work with is in an XML database, so that\n    when the driver root is once built into Ghostscript, new drivers\n    can be added without Ghostscript rebuild (the first plug-in\n    approach for Ghostscript drivers).<p>\n\n    Omni provides a model for dynamically loading printer drivers,\n    creating new devices by editing XML device description files, and\n    simplifies new printer driver development by allowing for the\n    subclassing of previous device features.<p>\n\n    It was also planned to add run-time integration of printers\n    described by <a\n    href=\"http://www.pwg.org/updf/index.html\">UPDF</a>\n    files. Initial code for that is already in the package.<p>\n\n    Foomatic data and CUPS PPD files are built by the driver\n    package. The versions 0.9.1 and 0.9.2 of Omni you find also <a\n    href=\"/download/printing/omni/\">here</a>.<p>",
