I set my printer to emulate the Epson LQ 1050 and selected the following driver from the list:  Epson Dot Matrix 24 pin.\nThe setup worked for the three set up tests: ASCII, PostScript, and direct to port.  Haven't tried anything else yet.  This driver should work for most Panasonic 24 pin dot matrix printers.<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: cartridge ribbon<p>"
