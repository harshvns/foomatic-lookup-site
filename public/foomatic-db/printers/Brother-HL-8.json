This <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/ghostscript-pcl-patches/inputslot.patch\">patch</a>\n    for GPL Ghostscript 8.63 fixes the problem and allows to set the\n    input tray with the \"-dMediaPosition=X\" commmand line\n    option for Ghostscript. \"X\" is an integer number which\n    depends on the printer model and tray. For HP \"0\" is\n    usually the printer default, \"7\" automatic selection,\n    \"2\" manual feed, \"1\" the upper, and\n    \"4\" the lower tray. Note that for PCL 6/XL these numbers\n    are different. The patch is required for Ghostscript 8.63 and\n    older so that tray selection with the PPDs of this site works. The\n    bug is fixed in Ghostscript 8.64 or newer.<p>",

(anybody with mem-extensions to give\naway can contact me at tpo2@spin.ch)<p>\n\n    Brother publishes proprietary Linux drivers for CUPS and LPD for\n    most of their laser printers and multi-function devices, including\n    SANE drivers for the scanners.
