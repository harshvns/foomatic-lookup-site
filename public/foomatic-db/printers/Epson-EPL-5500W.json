This allows you to print via Samba with 300x300 dpi.\n<br>Keep in mind that there is no support for any Windows but Win95 and Win3.1(1).\n<br>Prints out completely black pages if Windows Box has not enough memory available.\n<br>Important! Mind the \"W\", there's a EPL-5500 without \"W\", too, this one might work."
