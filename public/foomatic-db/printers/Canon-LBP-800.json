So the driver does not need to run SUID\n    root. The access is done via the \"parport_pc\" kernel module and a\n    CUPS backend which comes with the driver. The driver does not work\n    with USB- or network-connected printers.<p>\n\n    The Foomatic PPD file for this driver is not available on\n    OpenPrinting because it is already contained in the driver\n    package.<p>",

  "notes": "A real \"winprinter\" as the LBP-660, LBP-600, and\n    LBP-460.<p>\n\n    Works with the free driver \"lbp800\" which is based on\n    reverse-engineering the undocumented proprietary protocol. The\n    driver works only for a parallel port connection, not for\n    USB.<p>\n\n    Note that the proprietary parallel port data transfer protocol is\n    non-standard and not very reliable. So use a cable as short as\n    possible to use this printer. The parallel port must be set to\n    bi-directional in the BIOS (should be already set on modern\n    PCs).<p>\n\n    If there is a PCL emulation, it is done by the Windows\n    driver.<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: EP22 cartridge / 2500 pages per cartridge.(A4letter @ 5%)<p>"
