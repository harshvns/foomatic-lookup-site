It's basically a rebadged Fuji-Xerox printer, with some\n    fairly advanced features. Of course, none of the features it has\n    are tied to the Windows(tm) OS in any way, shape, or form. But,\n    due to the short-sightedness of all the companies involved with\n    the manufacture of this printer, it was presented as such even\n    though something as trivial as documentation would have gone a\n    long way towards redeeming this particular oversight. But enough\n    ranting, we have mended the situation with the present\n    driver. :-)</i><p>\n\n    The driver is still in a very basic state and has several TODOs,\n    but it makes the printer at least working.<p>\n\n    As the PPD file is contained in the driver package we will not\n    provide PPD files here on OpenPrinting.<p>",

The trick is to replace the \"PCLXL\" by\n    \"DPL\" (probably \"Dell Printer Language\") in\n    the \"ENTER LANGUAGE\" PJL command. DPL is nothing else\n    then PCL XL.<p>\n\n    Thanks to Samuel Degrande for finding out that DPL is PCL-XL in\n    reality and a special driver, as James \"Shamus\" Hammons' (jlhamm\n    at acm dot org) \"dplix\" driver is not needed. Thanks to James\n    Hammons for testing this method of using Ghostscript's\n    PCL-XL driver.<p>\n\n    A Ghostscript bug in the driver breaks paper input tray\n    selection. This <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/ghostscript-pxl-patches/inputslot.patch\">patch</a>\n    for GPL Ghostscript 8.63 fixes the problem and allows to set the\n    input tray with the \"-dMediaPosition=X\" commmand line\n    option for Ghostscript. \"X\" is an integer number which\n    depends on the printer model and tray. For HP \"0\" is\n    usually the printer default, \"1\" automatic selection,\n    \"2\" manual feed, \"4\" the upper, and\n    \"5\" the lower tray. Note that for PCL 5/5e these numbers\n    are different. This patch is required for Ghostscript 8.63 and\n    older so that tray selection with the PPDs of this site works. The\n    bug is fixed in Ghostscript 8.64 or newer.<p>",
