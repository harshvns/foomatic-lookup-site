It's\n    based on Uli and Matthew's <a\n    href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=cdj850\">cdj850</a> and <a\n    href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=cdj880\">cdj880</a> drivers,\n    with a new front-end to speak the different RGB-encoded PCL flavor\n    used by these printers.<p>\n\n    The original source package is not provided any more on HP's web\n    sites. You can download it here from\n    OpenPrinting. Installation instructions you find in the\n    package.<p>\n\n    The provided source is for gs 6.01; it probably works against\n    anything at all recent. It is also contained in ESP Ghostscript\n    7.07, 8.15, and later and GPL Ghostscript 8.60 and later. So all\n    distributions using these Ghostscript versions and perhaps also\n    others will ship this driver.<p>\n\n    After getting a tip from the driver's author I (Till) succeeded to\n    compile it for GNU Ghostscript 5.50. You must copy the function\n    \"gdev_pcl_mode9compress\" from the gdevcd8.c file of the <a\n    href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=cdj880\">cdj880</a> driver\n    into the end of the gdevcd8.c of HP's \"chp2200\" driver. Then you\n    follow the instructions in HP's source package and Ghostscript\n    will compile.<p>\n\n    (Former) Maintainer: siow-kiat_tan-at-hp.com.<p>",

As it\n    integrates directlty into the CUPS filtering system it is easy to\n    set up in any CUPS 1.1.x version without need of any additional\n    software. With Foomatic it is even possible to use this native\n    CUPS driver with other spoolers than CUPS.<p>\n\n    <li><em>Ghostscript IJS plug-in</em>: This is a\n    way use Gimp-Print as a Ghostscript driver without necessity of\n    patching and recompiling Ghostscript. It uses the <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/ijs/\">IJS</a>\n    plug-in interface as also <a\n    href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs\">HPIJS</a>\n    from HP or <a\n    href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/epsonepl/\">the\n    drivers for the Epson EPL-....L series</a> do. IJS drivers\n    can be used with any IJS enabled Ghostscript as ESP Ghostscript\n    7.x or newer, GNU Ghostscript 6.53 or newer, APFL Ghostscript 7.04\n    or newer. With the Foomatic data coming with Gimp-Print and the\n    current <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/foomatic.html\">Foomatic</a>\n    packages PPD files for use with all printing systems (CUPS, LPRng,\n    LPD, GNUlpr, PPR, PDQ, CPS, spooler-less printing) can be\n    generated. Print queues set up with these PPD files and\n    <tt>foomatic-rip</tt> give full access to all options\n    of the Gimp-Print driver.<p>\n\n    <li><em>Ghostscript built-in driver</em>: This\n    is a classical Ghostscript driver based on code compiled into the\n    Ghostscript executable. The Gimp-Print package also contains the\n    Foomatic data to generate PPDs for this driver. Note that the IJS\n    driver gives the same functionality and is much easier to\n    install.

Therefore we do not provide PPD\n    files for download here.<p>\n\n    If you got Gimp-Print with your operating system distribution, use\n    the printer setup program coming with your distribution. Otherwise\n    it is recommended to use the CUPS driver if you use CUPS as your\n    printing system or the IJS driver if you use another spooler. Do\n    not use the Ghostscript built-in driver \"stp\" as it is\n    obsolete.<p>\n\n    <b>IMPORTANT: Always use the Foomatic data and/or\n    PPD files of the Gimp-Print version which you are actually using!\n    Remove and re-create your print queues after every update of\n    Gimp-Print. If you are using the Gimp-Print package of your Linux\n    distribution, it is possible that the Foomatic data and/or the PPD\n    files can be in separate packages. Make sure you install them and\n    that they are of the version corresponding to your Gimp-Print\n    package.</b><p>\n\n    The information currently here corresponds to driver version\n    4.2.7.

The HPLIP project provides printing\n   support for over 3000 printer models, including Deskjet,\n   Officejet, Photosmart, PSC (Print, Scan, Copy), Business Inkjet, Envy,\n   NeverStop, Smart Tank, Tango, DesignJet,\n   (Color) LaserJet, Mopier, Edgeline MFP, and LaserJet MFP.<P>\n\n   Note that most HP models are supported, but a few are not. See\n   <a\n   href=\"https://developers.hp.com/hp-linux-imaging-and-printing/supported_devices/index\">Supported\n   Devices</a> at the HPLIP website for more\n   information.<P>\n\n   HPLIP is free, open source software distributed under the MIT, BSD,\n   and GPL licenses. HP does not provide formal consumer or commercial\n   support for this software.<P>\n\n   HPLIP contains two flavors of the printer driver. The default\n   driver is the CUPS Raster driver \"hpcups\" and as alternative the\n   older IJS-based HPIJS driver is still available, but its development and\n   support has been discontinued. In addition there\n   are ready-made PPD files for all supported PostScript printers, so\n   that they get used in PostScript mode. HPLIP ships updated PPD\n   files for all HP printers and both driver flavors. Therefore we do\n   not provide PPD files here. For non-HP printers which work with\n   HPIJS we provide PPDs via the driver entries \"<a\n   href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs-pcl3\">hpijs-pcl3</a>\",\n   \"<a\n   href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs-pcl5e\">hpijs-pcl5e</a>\",\n   \"<a\n   href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs-pcl5c\">hpijs-pcl5c</a>\".<P>",
