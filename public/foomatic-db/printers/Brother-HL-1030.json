It also provides some options as paper source and\n    toner saving.<p>\n\n    It is available from Ghostscript 6.10 on, or as a patch for gs\n    5.50. For the Ghostscript versions already containing the driver\n    there are patches to update to a new version (these patches are\n    needed to get 600x600 dpi on the HL-1030/1240 and compatible to\n    work). From GNU Ghostscript 6.53/APFL Ghostscript 7.04 on the\n    complete driver with 600-dpi support on the HL-1030/1240 is\n    included.<p>\n\n    In later Ghostscript versions the driver was removed again, use\n    <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/GS-7,05-MissingDrivers-1.tar.gz\">this\n    package</a> to add this and some other removed drivers to\n    Ghostscript 7.x (already added in ESP Ghostscript 7.x) or <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/ghostscript-8.x/drivers/hl1250/\">these\n    files</a> for GPL/AFPL Ghostscript 8.x (already there in ESP\n    Ghostscript 8.x). If you want to add the driver to your\n    Ghostscript 8.x, put the <tt>gdevhl12.c</tt> file into\n    the <tt>src/</tt> subdirectory of the Ghostscript\n    source package, append <tt>gdevhl12-hl1250.mak</tt> to\n    <tt>src/contrib.mak</tt>, and add\n    \"<tt>$(DD)hl1250.dev</tt>\" to one of the\n    \"<tt>DEVICE_DEVS...</tt>\" lines of\n    <tt>src/Makefile.in</tt>. Then compile as\n    ususal.<p>",
