Generally, for Postscript\n    printers, you will not need a driver, as all applications produce\n    PostScript. For the printing system getting access to the\n    printer-specific features the manufacturer supplies a PPD file for\n    every PostScript printer. Use this PPD file instead of a\n    Foomatic-generated one to get all functionality of your PostScript\n    printer working. The files provided by Foomatic are generic files\n    which contain only some standard options, use them only if you do\n    not find an appropriate PPD for your printer.<p>\n\n    One can make use of all functionality which the PostScript\n    printers have under Windows/MacOS when one uses the PPD file\n    coming with the printer, downloaded from <a\n    href=\"/download/PPD/\">here on OpenPrinting</a>, from the\n    manufacturer's home page, or from <a\n    href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/printerdrivers/winppd.html\">Adobe's</a>\n    web site (do \"<tt>unzip -L [filename].EXE</tt>\" to get the\n    PPD files). If there are several different PPD files for your\n    printer model and none dedicated for Linux or Unix, the PPD for\n    Windows NT works best in most cases.<p>\n\n    CUPS and PPR support PPD files directly, LPD/GNUlpr/LPRng, PDQ,\n    CPS, and spooler-less users can set up their printers with\n    <tt>foomatic-rip</tt> as they would set up a printer\n    with a Foomatic PPD file. <tt>foomatic-rip</tt> works\n    as well with manufacturer-supplied PostScript PPD files. This way\n    all PostScript printers work perfectly under GNU/Linux or other\n    free operating systems. Ghostscript is not needed for them. See\n    also our <a href=\"ppd-doc.html\">PPD documentation\n    page</a> for instructions.<p>\n\n    See the tutorial chapter \"<a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/kpfeifle/LinuxKongress2002/Tutorial/III.PostScript-and-PPDs/III.PostScript-and-PPDs.html\">Some\n    Theoretical Background: CUPS, PPDs, PostScript, and\n    Ghostscript</a>\" (<a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/kpfeifle/LinuxKongress2002/Tutorial/III.PostScript-and-PPDs/III.PostScript-and-PPDs.pdf\">PDF</a>)\n    for detailed information about PostScript and PPD files.<p>",

  "notes": "I used the original PPD (supposedly just written to support MacOS\n    and MS Win printing) with CUPS, which can use LPD as a backend to\n    send the print data out. All options can be used: select 1 of 5\n    trays; choose A4, Letter, A3, A3 FullBleed etc.; duplex printing;\n    print on forms; 1-up, 2-up,...16-up; use watermarks; RipNHold; 2\n    output destinations with face up or down each etc.<p>\n\n    The device at the moment is run by a (MS Windows NT Server based)\n    Harlequin RIP which is upgraded by the MicroPress software; after\n    you've sent the job to the (NT-) RIP (which sends the binary\n    TIFF-like data to the output device), the RIP can keep your RIPped\n    data in the form of bitmapped pages for further manipulation:\n    preview, delete pages; insert pages from a different job; merge\n    jobs; rearrange the order of pages; use different imposition\n    schemes; delete areas on pages or move, invert, scale or rotate\n    them; paginate the pages etc.<p>\n\n    After the manipulations there is no need of re-RIPping; the\n    printers start printing immediately putting out paper. The system\n    is used for purposes like \"print on Demand\" (PoD),\n    personalised printing, print variable data, 1:1 marketing, jobs\n    that often need a re-print with some minor changes in between\n    print runs (when it is much more expensive to do the\n    time-consuming process to re-RIP the complete data again and\n    again).  It is a system for professional digital printing capable\n    of doing up to 400.000 prints per month per unit.<p>\n\n    The system is capable of running as a print cluster of up to 12\n    connected printer units which can share a huge job amongst\n    themselves or work on different ones each. (The maximum cluster\n    gives you 840 ppm and a monthly volume of 4.8 million\n    prints).<p>\n\n    (tested by Kurt Pfeifle)<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: toner<p>"
