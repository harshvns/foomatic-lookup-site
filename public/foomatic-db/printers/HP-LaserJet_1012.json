Its\n    primary goal is uncompromising quality.  Epson Stylus printers in\n    particular are supported in all resolutions and modes, and the\n    latest printers are capable of producing prints that rival\n    photographic prints in quality. This package also offers much\n    faster printing for high quality text and presentation graphics\n    when required.<p>\n\n    Gutenprint is the successor of Gimp-Print, it was renamed with\n    the change from version 4.x to 5.x. All printers which worked with\n    Gimp-Print before, work also (and hopefully better) with\n    Gutenprint.<p>\n\n    The actual printer drivers are in the Gutenprint library. To give\n    access to them Gutenprint has various interfaces:<p>\n\n    <ol>\n\n    <li><em>Plug-in for the GIMP</em>: This plug-in\n    provides a printing dialog for the GIMP to print images directly,\n    and graphical controls to adjust the rich set of options of the\n    Gutenprint drivers. The possibility to integrate a PPD file and to\n    print PostScript allows to use the plug-in also with Ghostscript\n    drivers other than Gutenprint or on PostScript printers.<p>\n\n    <li><em>Native CUPS driver</em>: This interface\n    makes it possible to set up print queues under CUPS so that one\n    can print from any application or from the command line. As it\n    integrates directlty into the CUPS filtering system it is easy to\n    set up in any CUPS 1.1.x or CUPS 1.2.x version without need of any\n    additional software. With Foomatic it is even possible to use this\n    native CUPS driver with other spoolers than CUPS.<p>\n\n    <li><em>Ghostscript IJS plug-in</em>: This is a\n    way to use Gutenprint as a Ghostscript driver without necessity of\n    patching and recompiling Ghostscript. It uses the <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/ijs/\">IJS</a>\n    plug-in interface as also <a\n    href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs\">HPIJS</a>\n    from HP or <a\n    href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/epsonepl/\">the\n    drivers for the Epson EPL-....L series</a> do. IJS drivers\n    can be used with any IJS-enabled Ghostscript as ESP Ghostscript\n    7.x or newer, GNU Ghostscript 6.53 or newer, APFL Ghostscript 7.04\n    or newer. With the Foomatic data coming with Gutenprint and the\n    current <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/foomatic.html\">Foomatic</a>\n    packages PPD files for use with all printing systems (CUPS, LPRng,\n    LPD, GNUlpr, PPR, PDQ, CPS, spooler-less printing) can be\n    generated. Print queues set up with these PPD files and\n    <tt>foomatic-rip</tt> give full access to all options\n    of the Gutenprint driver.<p>\n\n    </ol>\n\n    The Gutenprint package already ships with all needed PPD files for\n    CUPS and data files for Foomatic. Therefore we do not provide PPD\n    files for download here.<p>\n\n    If you got Gutenprint with your operating system distribution, use\n    the printer setup program coming with your distribution. Otherwise\n    it is recommended to use the CUPS driver if you use CUPS as your\n    printing system or the IJS driver if you use another\n    spooler.<p>\n\n    <b>IMPORTANT: Always use the Foomatic data and/or\n    PPD files of the Gutenprint version which you are actually using!\n    Remove and re-create your print queues after every update of\n    Gutenprint. If you are using the Gutenprint package of your Linux\n    distribution, it is possible that the Foomatic data and/or the PPD\n    files can be in separate packages. Make sure you install them and\n    that they are of the version corresponding to your Gutenprint\n    package.</b><p>\n\n    The information currently here corresponds to driver version\n    5.2.7. If you use another version, have a look in the\n    documentation coming with your Gutenprint package. If you have\n    still a 4.x version of Gimp-Print, it is highly recommended to\n    upgrade at least to Gutenprint 5.0.x.<p>\n\n    The driver package which is available for download here on this\n    site only contains the CUPS driver and the utilities (escputil,\n    cups-calibrate), it does not contain the IJS driver and the GIMP\n    plug-in.<p>",

The HPLIP project provides printing\n   support for over 3000 printer models, including Deskjet,\n   Officejet, Photosmart, PSC (Print, Scan, Copy), Business Inkjet, Envy,\n   NeverStop, Smart Tank, Tango, DesignJet,\n   (Color) LaserJet, Mopier, Edgeline MFP, and LaserJet MFP.<P>\n\n   Note that most HP models are supported, but a few are not. See\n   <a\n   href=\"https://developers.hp.com/hp-linux-imaging-and-printing/supported_devices/index\">Supported\n   Devices</a> at the HPLIP website for more\n   information.<P>\n\n   HPLIP is free, open source software distributed under the MIT, BSD,\n   and GPL licenses. HP does not provide formal consumer or commercial\n   support for this software.<P>\n\n   HPLIP contains two flavors of the printer driver. The default\n   driver is the CUPS Raster driver \"hpcups\" and as alternative the\n   older IJS-based HPIJS driver is still available, but its development and\n   support has been discontinued. In addition there\n   are ready-made PPD files for all supported PostScript printers, so\n   that they get used in PostScript mode. HPLIP ships updated PPD\n   files for all HP printers and both driver flavors. Therefore we do\n   not provide PPD files here. For non-HP printers which work with\n   HPIJS we provide PPDs via the driver entries \"<a\n   href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs-pcl3\">hpijs-pcl3</a>\",\n   \"<a\n   href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs-pcl5e\">hpijs-pcl5e</a>\",\n   \"<a\n   href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs-pcl5c\">hpijs-pcl5c</a>\".<P>",

      "comments": "\"pxl1010\" is not a new driver, but a special way of using the\n    \"pxlmono\" Ghostscript driver to make the HP LaserJet 1010 and 1012\n    work reliably.  The trick is to add a special sequence of 8 bytes\n    at the BeginSession operator of the PCL-XL data stream.<p>\n\n    Simply using \"pxlmono\" does not print anything and using a PCL-5e\n    driver (HPIJS, \"ljet4\", ...) leads in principle to the jobs being\n    printed, but sometimes the printer crashes with an \"Unsupported\n    personality: PCL\" message.<p>\n\n    Thanks to Carl Michal (michal at physics dot ubc dot ca) for\n    finding out that. He analyzed the output of the Windows driver,\n    where he found this \"magic\" 8-byte sequence.<p>\n\n    A Ghostscript bug in the driver breaks paper input tray\n    selection. This <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/ghostscript-pxl-patches/inputslot.patch\">patch</a>\n    for GPL Ghostscript 8.63 fixes the problem and allows to set the\n    input tray with the \"-dMediaPosition=X\" commmand line\n    option for Ghostscript. \"X\" is an integer number which\n    depends on the printer model and tray. For HP \"0\" is\n    usually the printer default, \"1\" automatic selection,\n    \"2\" manual feed, \"4\" the upper, and\n    \"5\" the lower tray. Note that for PCL 5/5e these numbers\n    are different. This patch is required for Ghostscript 8.63 and\n    older so that tray selection with the PPDs of this site works. The\n    bug is fixed in Ghostscript 8.64 or newer.<p>",

Somewhat faster than\n    the LaserJet 1010, \"Fastres 1200\" resolution enhancement.<p>\n\n    HP classifies this printer as \"host-based\" whereas they claim the\n    HP LaserJet 1015 to understand PCL 5e. But the HP LaserJet 1010\n    and 1012 seem to understand a stripped-down (raster-graphics only,\n    no text) variant of PCL 5e.<p>\n\n    Rick Richardson (rickr at mn dot rr dot com), author of the\n    \"foo2zjs\" driver (driver for the HP LaserJet 1000/1005),\n    has examined the output of the Windows driver for this printer and\n    found out that the language looks like PJL + PCL 6 (see report\n    on the HP forum on OpenPrinting).<p>\n\n    Adam (madaman at web dot de) reports on the HP forum on\n    OpenPrinting that the HP LaserJet 1010 works for him with all\n    raster drivers for the HP LaserJet 1100 (HPLIP,\n    \"ljet4\", \"lj4dith\", \"gimp-print\").

Sometimes it happens that the printer stops working\n    and reports the error \"<tt>Unsupported Personality:\n    PCL</tt>\". It only continues working when one kills the job\n    and power-cycles the printer.<p>\n\n    The problem of the \"<tt>Unsupported Personality:\n    PCL</tt>\" was finally solved by Carl Michal (michal at\n    physics dot ubc dot ca). By analyzing the output of the Windows\n    driver he found out that after the BeginSession operator in the\n    beginning of a PCL 6 job a special sequence of 8 bytes has to be\n    added. He added it by a filter to the output of Ghostscript's\n    \"pxlmono\" driver and from then on the printer worked (Implemented\n    as the \"pxl1010\" driver on this site).<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Toner and drum in one cartridge (18000 pages)<p>"
