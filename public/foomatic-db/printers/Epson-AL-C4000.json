It does not support the Epson EPL \"L\" series. There\n    you have to use the third-party driver \"<a\n    href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/epsonepl/\">epsonepl</a>\".<p>\n\n    Here some hints for older versions of the driver:<p>\n\n    Version 1.0.4 of this driver works only with Ghostscript 5.50, not\n    with Ghostscript 6.5x and newer.  For the new Ghostscript versions\n    use <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/ghostscript-6.51-Epson_eplaseren.patch\">this\n    patch</a> from Crutcher Dunnavant (Red Hat).<p>\n\n    Version 3.0.2 is prepared for both Ghostscript 5.x and 6.x. For\n    Ghostscript 7.x or newer a small fix is needed: Execute the\n    following command line in the main directory of the unpacked\n    driver source package:<p>\n\n    <tt>perl -p -i -e\n    \"s/GS_VERSION_MAJOR\\s*==\\s*6/GS_VERSION_MAJOR &gt;=\n    6/\" gdevescv.c gdevesmv.c</tt><p>\n\n    Then the driver also compiles with these versions of\n    Ghostscript.<p>",

It comes as a part of HPLIP, HP Linux\n   Imaging and Printing. HPLIP is a complete driver suite which also\n   includes scanning, copying, and fax drivers for multi-function\n   devices and also the printer maintenance and management utility\n   hp-toolbox.<P>\n\n   The HPIJS driver is only one of the two flavors of HP's printer\n   driver. HP has recently added the CUPS Raster driver hpcups and\n   uses this driver by default currently. HPIJS is still included in\n   HPLIP, but more for backward compatibility.<P>\n\n   HP provides PPD files for all their supported printers and both\n   driver flavors.<P>\n\n   Many non-HP printers are compatible to HP printers as they use the\n   same page description language, PCL 5e. This language was\n   introduced with the HP LaserJet 4 and it is probably the most used\n   standard page description language after PostScript. Even most of\n   the PostScript printers understand PCL 5e which can be used as\n   alternative language if the printer has not enough memory to render\n   PostScript. This driver entry generates PPD files to use HPIJS with\n   PCL 5e laser printers which are not from HP, and so allows the use\n   of this high-quality printer driver with a wide range of\n   printers.<P>\n\n   Double-sided printing and tray selection is supported, but tray numbers\n   may be different.<P>",

It is probably widely used, as it is part of Ghostscript\n    and does not require any extra software, but before Ghostscript\n    8.x its output quality was lousy and one has searched for\n    alternative drivers. From Ghostscript 8.x the well-tempered\n    screening was introduced which gives much better quality for\n    half-tone images. You can make use of it by downloading the PPD\n    file for your printer here and using the \"HalftoningAlgorithm\"\n    option.<p>\n\n    The <a\n    href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=lj4dith\">\"lj4dith\"</a>\n    Ghostscript driver which uses Floyd-Steinberg dithering to improve\n    the image output quality. Unfortunately, this driver has problems\n    with the margins. The document is not placed exactly at the same\n    position as with the \"ljet4\" driver. The page seems to be shifted\n    to the upper right, probably due to the upper and right\n    unprintable borders not taken into account. Formerly, you could\n    use the driver with the same PPD file as \"ljet4\", simply by\n    switching an option, but we have removed this feature due to the\n    paper size problem. Use Well-Tempered screening if you want to\n    enhance the image printing quality.<p>\n\n    Use the <a\n    href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=ljet4d\">\"ljet4d\"</a>\n    Ghostscript driver for Duplex (double-sided printing)\n    support.<p>\n\n    A Ghostscript bug in the driver breaks paper input tray\n    selection. This <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/ghostscript-pcl-patches/inputslot.patch\">patch</a>\n    for GPL Ghostscript 8.63 fixes the problem and allows to set the\n    input tray with the \"-dMediaPosition=X\" commmand line\n    option for Ghostscript. \"X\" is an integer number which\n    depends on the printer model and tray. For HP \"0\" is\n    usually the printer default, \"7\" automatic selection,\n    \"2\" manual feed, \"1\" the upper, and\n    \"4\" the lower tray. Note that for PCL 6/XL these numbers\n    are different. The patch is required for Ghostscript 8.63 and\n    older so that tray selection with the PPDs of this site works. The\n    bug is fixed in Ghostscript 8.64 or newer.<p>\n\n    A good PCL 5e driver is <a\n    href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs-pcl5e\">HPIJS</a>\n    which is developed by HP to support their non-PostScript laser\n    printers. <a\n    href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=gutenprint\">Gutenprint</a>\n    supports even PCL 4, 5, and 5e so that it serves as an alternative\n    driver even for older printers. Gutenprint has many dithering\n    algorithms to choose, but most are optimized for inkjets.<p>\n\n    Note that many printers listed as supported by this driver also\n    understand PCL-XL and so they can be used with the\n    \"lj5gray\" and\n    \"pxlmono\"/\"pxlcolor\" drivers which give a much\n    higher output quality and resolutions up to 1200 dpi,<p>\n\n    Unfortunately, the PCL drivers are not always absolutely\n    compatible with every printer.",
