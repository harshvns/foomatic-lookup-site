Please follow the instructions comming with the driver.\n\n\t<p>\n\n\tTill Kamppeter has tested this driver on the LaserJet 1022 and\n        there the driver works very well. It is faster and more\n        reliable then the HPIJS driver for the PCL 5e mode of this\n        model.\n\n\t<p>\n\n\tPPD files (and the Foomatic XML files to generate them) come\n\twith the driver, therefore we do not supply PPDs here on the\n\tOpenPrinting site.",
