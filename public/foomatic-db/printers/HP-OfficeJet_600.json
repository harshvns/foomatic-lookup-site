The HPLIP project provides printing\n   support for over 3000 printer models, including Deskjet,\n   Officejet, Photosmart, PSC (Print, Scan, Copy), Business Inkjet, Envy,\n   NeverStop, Smart Tank, Tango, DesignJet,\n   (Color) LaserJet, Mopier, Edgeline MFP, and LaserJet MFP.<P>\n\n   Note that most HP models are supported, but a few are not. See\n   <a\n   href=\"https://developers.hp.com/hp-linux-imaging-and-printing/supported_devices/index\">Supported\n   Devices</a> at the HPLIP website for more\n   information.<P>\n\n   HPLIP is free, open source software distributed under the MIT, BSD,\n   and GPL licenses. HP does not provide formal consumer or commercial\n   support for this software.<P>\n\n   HPLIP contains two flavors of the printer driver. The default\n   driver is the CUPS Raster driver \"hpcups\" and as alternative the\n   older IJS-based HPIJS driver is still available, but its development and\n   support has been discontinued. In addition there\n   are ready-made PPD files for all supported PostScript printers, so\n   that they get used in PostScript mode. HPLIP ships updated PPD\n   files for all HP printers and both driver flavors. Therefore we do\n   not provide PPD files here. For non-HP printers which work with\n   HPIJS we provide PPDs via the driver entries \"<a\n   href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs-pcl3\">hpijs-pcl3</a>\",\n   \"<a\n   href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs-pcl5e\">hpijs-pcl5e</a>\",\n   \"<a\n   href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs-pcl5c\">hpijs-pcl5c</a>\".<P>",

This driver has many options (enter the command\n    \"man gs-pcl3\" in a terminal window\n    to get more information), so you can do a lot of fine-tuning, but\n    do not expect perfect results with the default settings. Due to\n    being able to set so many different options separately you can\n    even make rather exotic non-HP printers printing. To find out\n    their options you print into a file under Windows and then apply\n    the \"pcl3opts\" command (comes with\n    the driver) on the file. It returns the Ghostscript command line\n    which most probably prints in the mode of the printer for which\n    your file was generated under Windows.<p>\n\n    <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/download/printing/ghostscript-8.x/patches/ghostscript-8.15-pcl3-driver-api8.patch\">This\n    patch</a> adapts the driver to GPL/AFPL Ghostscript 8.x. In\n    ESP Ghostscript 8.x this driver is already included.<p>\n\n    Unfortunately, GNU Ghostscript 5.50 (and also <a\n    href=\"ftp://ftp2.easysw.com/pub/ghostscript/\">ESP\n    Ghostscript 5.50.1</a>) has a bug which often causes\n    segmentation faults when high amounts of memory are needed (high\n    resolutions, Floyd-Steinberg dithering). A workaround is to use\n    Ghostscript's \"-dMaxBitmap=value\" option with\n    \"value\" being the size of memory which Ghostscript\n    should be allowed to allocate for rendering one page. Try values\n    of 40000000 and higher. In the foomatic config files there is the\n    option \"Memory Limit\" to control this. Note that\n    Ghostscript can take up memory up to the given amount. So be sure\n    that you have enough swap space and note that your machine will\n    slow down considerably during the rendering process. This problem\n    does not appear with GNU or Alladin Ghostscript 6.x and\n    newer.<p>\n\n    For many printers, the <a\n    href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=gutenprint\">gutenprint</a>\n    driver and the drivers from <a\n    href=\"http://hpijs.sourceforge.net/\">HP</a> may\n    produce better color output.<p>",
