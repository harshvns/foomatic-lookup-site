It is unlikely that there will ever be Linux\n    drivers for the PagePro 1100L.<p>\n\n    Perhaps one can get it to work with the \"<a\n    href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=pbmtozjs\">pbmtozjs</a>\"\n    driver, in its source code \"Minolta\" is mentioned. Please post on\n    the Minolta forum on this site if you make the printer working\n    this way.<p>"
