Generally, for Postscript\n    printers, you will not need a driver, as all applications produce\n    PostScript. For the printing system getting access to the\n    printer-specific features the manufacturer supplies a PPD file for\n    every PostScript printer. Use this PPD file instead of a\n    Foomatic-generated one to get all functionality of your PostScript\n    printer working. The files provided by Foomatic are generic files\n    which contain only some standard options, use them only if you do\n    not find an appropriate PPD for your printer.<p>\n\n    One can make use of all functionality which the PostScript\n    printers have under Windows/MacOS when one uses the PPD file\n    coming with the printer, downloaded from <a\n    href=\"/download/PPD/\">here on OpenPrinting</a>, from the\n    manufacturer's home page, or from <a\n    href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/printerdrivers/winppd.html\">Adobe's</a>\n    web site (do \"<tt>unzip -L [filename].EXE</tt>\" to get the\n    PPD files). If there are several different PPD files for your\n    printer model and none dedicated for Linux or Unix, the PPD for\n    Windows NT works best in most cases.<p>\n\n    CUPS and PPR support PPD files directly, LPD/GNUlpr/LPRng, PDQ,\n    CPS, and spooler-less users can set up their printers with\n    <tt>foomatic-rip</tt> as they would set up a printer\n    with a Foomatic PPD file. <tt>foomatic-rip</tt> works\n    as well with manufacturer-supplied PostScript PPD files. This way\n    all PostScript printers work perfectly under GNU/Linux or other\n    free operating systems. Ghostscript is not needed for them. See\n    also our <a href=\"ppd-doc.html\">PPD documentation\n    page</a> for instructions.<p>\n\n    See the tutorial chapter \"<a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/kpfeifle/LinuxKongress2002/Tutorial/III.PostScript-and-PPDs/III.PostScript-and-PPDs.html\">Some\n    Theoretical Background: CUPS, PPDs, PostScript, and\n    Ghostscript</a>\" (<a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/kpfeifle/LinuxKongress2002/Tutorial/III.PostScript-and-PPDs/III.PostScript-and-PPDs.pdf\">PDF</a>)\n    for detailed information about PostScript and PPD files.<p>",

  "notes": "Is not sold for much longer, but will still be used in many\n    professional environments for a number of years because of its\n    still unique feature combination: 70 ppm; can do 3 different spot\n    colors concurrently (on top of default b+w printing); duplex\n    capabilities; a finishing device which can fold A3 and A4 paper;\n    thus outputting ready-made A4 and A5 booklets complete with a\n    saddle-stitched stapling; run by an Adobe PostScript Level 2 RIP\n    which lives in a SUN Sparc workstation.  I used the original PPD\n    (supposedly just written to support MacOS and MS Win printing)\n    with CUPS, which used its LPD backend to send the PostScript to\n    the printer. In this way all options of the printer can be\n    used.<p>\n\n    (tested by Kurt Pfeifle)<p><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: toner<p>"
