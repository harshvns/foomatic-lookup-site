      "comments": "Gimp-Print supports a wide variety of Epson Stylus, HP DeskJet,\n    LaserJet, Canon BubbleJet, Lexmark inkjet printers, with the\n    primary goal being uncompromising quality.  Epson Stylus printers\n    in particular are supported in all resolutions and modes, and the\n    latest printers are capable of producing prints that rival\n    photographic prints in quality. This package also offers much\n    faster printing for high quality text and presentation graphics\n    when required.<p>\n\n    The actual printer drivers are in the Gimp-Print library. To give\n    access to them Gimp-Print has various interfaces:<p>\n\n    <ol>\n\n    <li><em>Plug-in for the GIMP</em>: This plug-in\n    provides a printing dialog for the GIMP to print images directly,\n    and graphical controls to adjust the rich set of options of the\n    Gimp-Print drivers. The possibility to integrate a PPD file and to\n    print PostScript allows to use the plug-in also with Ghostscript\n    drivers other than Gimp-Print or on PostScript printers.<p>\n\n    <li><em>Native CUPS driver</em>: This interface\n    makes it possible to set up print queues under CUPS so that one\n    can print from any application or from the command line. As it\n    integrates directlty into the CUPS filtering system it is easy to\n    set up in any CUPS 1.1.x version without need of any additional\n    software. With Foomatic it is even possible to use this native\n    CUPS driver with other spoolers than CUPS.<p>\n\n    <li><em>Ghostscript IJS plug-in</em>: This is a\n    way use Gimp-Print as a Ghostscript driver without necessity of\n    patching and recompiling Ghostscript. It uses the <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/ijs/\">IJS</a>\n    plug-in interface as also <a\n    href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs\">HPIJS</a>\n    from HP or <a\n    href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/epsonepl/\">the\n    drivers for the Epson EPL-....L series</a> do. IJS drivers\n    can be used with any IJS enabled Ghostscript as ESP Ghostscript\n    7.x or newer, GNU Ghostscript 6.53 or newer, APFL Ghostscript 7.04\n    or newer. With the Foomatic data coming with Gimp-Print and the\n    current <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/foomatic.html\">Foomatic</a>\n    packages PPD files for use with all printing systems (CUPS, LPRng,\n    LPD, GNUlpr, PPR, PDQ, CPS, spooler-less printing) can be\n    generated. Print queues set up with these PPD files and\n    <tt>foomatic-rip</tt> give full access to all options\n    of the Gimp-Print driver.<p>\n\n    <li><em>Ghostscript built-in driver</em>: This\n    is a classical Ghostscript driver based on code compiled into the\n    Ghostscript executable. The Gimp-Print package also contains the\n    Foomatic data to generate PPDs for this driver. Note that the IJS\n    driver gives the same functionality and is much easier to\n    install. Therefore this interface of Gimp-Print is obsolete and\n    not part of Gimp-Print 4.3 (upcoming 5.0) any more.<p>\n\n    </ol>\n\n    The Gimp-Print package already ships with all needed PPD files for\n    CUPS and data files for Foomatic. Therefore we do not provide PPD\n    files for download here.<p>\n\n    If you got Gimp-Print with your operating system distribution, use\n    the printer setup program coming with your distribution. Otherwise\n    it is recommended to use the CUPS driver if you use CUPS as your\n    printing system or the IJS driver if you use another spooler. Do\n    not use the Ghostscript built-in driver \"stp\" as it is\n    obsolete.<p>\n\n    <b>IMPORTANT: Always use the Foomatic data and/or\n    PPD files of the Gimp-Print version which you are actually using!\n    Remove and re-create your print queues after every update of\n    Gimp-Print. If you are using the Gimp-Print package of your Linux\n    distribution, it is possible that the Foomatic data and/or the PPD\n    files can be in separate packages. Make sure you install them and\n    that they are of the version corresponding to your Gimp-Print\n    package.</b><p>\n\n    The information currently here corresponds to driver version\n    4.2.7. If you use another version, have a look in the\n    documentation coming with your Gimp-Print package. If you have\n    still a 4.0.x version of Gimp-Print, it is highly recommended to\n    upgrade to 4.2.x.<p>",
