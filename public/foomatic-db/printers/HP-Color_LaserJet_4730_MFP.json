Generally, for Postscript\n    printers, you will not need a driver, as all applications produce\n    PostScript. For the printing system getting access to the\n    printer-specific features the manufacturer supplies a PPD file for\n    every PostScript printer. Use this PPD file instead of a\n    Foomatic-generated one to get all functionality of your PostScript\n    printer working. The files provided by Foomatic are generic files\n    which contain only some standard options, use them only if you do\n    not find an appropriate PPD for your printer.<p>\n\n    One can make use of all functionality which the PostScript\n    printers have under Windows/MacOS when one uses the PPD file\n    coming with the printer, downloaded from <a\n    href=\"/download/PPD/\">here on OpenPrinting</a>, from the\n    manufacturer's home page, or from <a\n    href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/printerdrivers/winppd.html\">Adobe's</a>\n    web site (do \"<tt>unzip -L [filename].EXE</tt>\" to get the\n    PPD files). If there are several different PPD files for your\n    printer model and none dedicated for Linux or Unix, the PPD for\n    Windows NT works best in most cases.<p>\n\n    CUPS and PPR support PPD files directly, LPD/GNUlpr/LPRng, PDQ,\n    CPS, and spooler-less users can set up their printers with\n    <tt>foomatic-rip</tt> as they would set up a printer\n    with a Foomatic PPD file. <tt>foomatic-rip</tt> works\n    as well with manufacturer-supplied PostScript PPD files. This way\n    all PostScript printers work perfectly under GNU/Linux or other\n    free operating systems. Ghostscript is not needed for them. See\n    also our <a href=\"ppd-doc.html\">PPD documentation\n    page</a> for instructions.<p>\n\n    See the tutorial chapter \"<a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/kpfeifle/LinuxKongress2002/Tutorial/III.PostScript-and-PPDs/III.PostScript-and-PPDs.html\">Some\n    Theoretical Background: CUPS, PPDs, PostScript, and\n    Ghostscript</a>\" (<a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/kpfeifle/LinuxKongress2002/Tutorial/III.PostScript-and-PPDs/III.PostScript-and-PPDs.pdf\">PDF</a>)\n    for detailed information about PostScript and PPD files.<p>",

The HPLIP project provides printing\n   support for over 3000 printer models, including Deskjet,\n   Officejet, Photosmart, PSC (Print, Scan, Copy), Business Inkjet, Envy,\n   NeverStop, Smart Tank, Tango, DesignJet,\n   (Color) LaserJet, Mopier, Edgeline MFP, and LaserJet MFP.<P>\n\n   Note that most HP models are supported, but a few are not. See\n   <a\n   href=\"https://developers.hp.com/hp-linux-imaging-and-printing/supported_devices/index\">Supported\n   Devices</a> at the HPLIP website for more\n   information.<P>\n\n   HPLIP is free, open source software distributed under the MIT, BSD,\n   and GPL licenses. HP does not provide formal consumer or commercial\n   support for this software.<P>\n\n   HPLIP contains two flavors of the printer driver. The default\n   driver is the CUPS Raster driver \"hpcups\" and as alternative the\n   older IJS-based HPIJS driver is still available, but its development and\n   support has been discontinued. In addition there\n   are ready-made PPD files for all supported PostScript printers, so\n   that they get used in PostScript mode. HPLIP ships updated PPD\n   files for all HP printers and both driver flavors. Therefore we do\n   not provide PPD files here. For non-HP printers which work with\n   HPIJS we provide PPDs via the driver entries \"<a\n   href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs-pcl3\">hpijs-pcl3</a>\",\n   \"<a\n   href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs-pcl5e\">hpijs-pcl5e</a>\",\n   \"<a\n   href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs-pcl5c\">hpijs-pcl5c</a>\".<P>",
