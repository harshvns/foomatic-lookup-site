  "notes": "This printer was made in 1984. It's basicly a dot matrix\n    printer with an inkjet print head. It takes tractor feed paper. I\n    set it up as text only in printtool.<p>\n\n    In CUPS set up a raw (=unfiltered) queue with:<p>\n\n    <tt>lpadmin -p thinkjet -E -v\n    parallel:/dev/lp0</tt><p>\n\n    Note that you get a raw queue when you do not provide a PPD\n    file.<p>\n\n    It is rated as \"Partially\" working because there must be\n    a possibility to print graphics with it.<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Cartridge is about $25<p>"
