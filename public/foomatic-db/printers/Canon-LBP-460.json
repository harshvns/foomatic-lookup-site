It must\n    be configured for bidirectional access and it must use the I/O\n    address 0x378. The driver must run SUID \"root\", so the printer is\n    not suitable for security-critical systems. Any output destination\n    specified in the printer spooler will be ignored.<p>\n\n    The Foomatic PPD files for this driver are not available on\n    OpenPrinting because they are already contained in the driver\n    package.<p>",

Then Rildo Pragana has added support for the\n      LBP-460 to the driver, using an LBP-460 which Till Kamppeter\n      brought him from Mandriva (Mandrakesoft in that time).<br>\n\n      Old comments:<br>\n\n      PCL4/LJIIp emulation via Windows driver. When LBP460 is\n      connected to W9x box, Linux can use it as SMB network-available\n      HPLJ III. Both text and Ghostscript work.<br><p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: toner cartridge<p>"
