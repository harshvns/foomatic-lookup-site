      "comments": "Driver for the Pentax PocketJet series written by Rildo Pragana\n    (author of the \"ml85p\" driver for Samsung laser\n    winprinters) in cooperation with Pentax.<p>\n \n    Rildo's announcement for this driver:<p>\n\n    <i>Pentax Technologies manufacture a nice family of printers,\n    PocketJet II and PocketJet 200. They signed a contract with me for\n    developing a Linux driver for their printers, to be released under\n    GPL. So they are good guys, don't you think so? I do. I'm still\n    working on it, but here is the first public release of the driver,\n    with graphical install and configuration tools. If you have a\n    laptop or notebook computer, those printers are a must to\n    have. They operate on thermal paper, so no ink cartdriges to\n    change. And its size and weight are very convenient. I know\n    because I use mine :^)</i><p>\n\n    The driver is a wrapper around Ghostscript, so you only call the\n    driver executable with some simple options to print from the\n    command line. This makes it also very convenient to use the driver\n    without spooler, which is important on PDAs with limited memory\n    space.",

  "notes": "Ultra-portable printer which weighs around one pound (513g) with\n    battery. Its size is only 10.4in x 1.18in x 2.17in (255mm x 30mm x\n    55mm). The printer is a direct thermal printer and so it needs\n    special thermal paper. Pentax provides so-called \"Pentax\n    Quality Paper\" which is much thicker and not so glossy as fax\n    rolls, so one can probably use this printer even for\n    correspondence. Due to the thermal printing the only moving part\n    in it is the mechanics to advance the paper. this seems to be one\n    important fact to get it so small.<p>\n\n    The printer is not only intended to be used with notebook\n    computers, but also with handhelds and PDAs. It has a parallel\n    port built-in, serial adapter, and one gets USB and IR adapters\n    and also a parallel cable as option, and drivers for handhelds and\n    PDAs are available.<p>\n\n    This 200-dpi model is made more for PDAs, there is also the\n    PocketJet II with 300 dpi which is more suitable for\n    notebooks.<p>\n\n    This printer is light, but not a \"Paperweight\". Rildo\n    Pragana, the author of the \"ml85p\" driver (for the\n    Samsung ML-85P laser winprinter), made a free software driver for\n    this printer in cooperation with Pentax. So this you can really\n    use this printer with your portable computer running a free\n    operating system.<p>\n\n      Consumables/Refills: Special \"Pentax Quality\" thermal paper, $8.49/100 sheet\n\tLetter. No ink or ribbons needed.<p>"
