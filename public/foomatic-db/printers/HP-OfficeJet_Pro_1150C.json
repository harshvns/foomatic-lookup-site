The possibility to integrate a PPD file and to\n    print PostScript allows to use the plug-in also with Ghostscript\n    drivers other than Gimp-Print or on PostScript printers.<p>\n\n    <li><em>Native CUPS driver</em>: This interface\n    makes it possible to set up print queues under CUPS so that one\n    can print from any application or from the command line. As it\n    integrates directlty into the CUPS filtering system it is easy to\n    set up in any CUPS 1.1.x version without need of any additional\n    software. With Foomatic it is even possible to use this native\n    CUPS driver with other spoolers than CUPS.<p>\n\n    <li><em>Ghostscript IJS plug-in</em>: This is a\n    way use Gimp-Print as a Ghostscript driver without necessity of\n    patching and recompiling Ghostscript. It uses the <a\n    href=\"http://www.openprinting.org/ijs/\">IJS</a>\n    plug-in interface as also <a\n    href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs\">HPIJS</a>\n    from HP or <a\n    href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/epsonepl/\">the\n    drivers for the Epson EPL-....L series</a> do. IJS drivers\n    can be used with any IJS enabled Ghostscript as ESP Ghostscript\n    7.x or newer, GNU Ghostscript 6.53 or newer, APFL Ghostscript 7.04\n    or newer.

Print queues set up with these PPD files and\n    <tt>foomatic-rip</tt> give full access to all options\n    of the Gimp-Print driver.<p>\n\n    <li><em>Ghostscript built-in driver</em>: This\n    is a classical Ghostscript driver based on code compiled into the\n    Ghostscript executable. The Gimp-Print package also contains the\n    Foomatic data to generate PPDs for this driver. Note that the IJS\n    driver gives the same functionality and is much easier to\n    install.

The HPLIP project provides printing\n   support for over 3000 printer models, including Deskjet,\n   Officejet, Photosmart, PSC (Print, Scan, Copy), Business Inkjet, Envy,\n   NeverStop, Smart Tank, Tango, DesignJet,\n   (Color) LaserJet, Mopier, Edgeline MFP, and LaserJet MFP.<P>\n\n   Note that most HP models are supported, but a few are not. See\n   <a\n   href=\"https://developers.hp.com/hp-linux-imaging-and-printing/supported_devices/index\">Supported\n   Devices</a> at the HPLIP website for more\n   information.<P>\n\n   HPLIP is free, open source software distributed under the MIT, BSD,\n   and GPL licenses. HP does not provide formal consumer or commercial\n   support for this software.<P>\n\n   HPLIP contains two flavors of the printer driver. The default\n   driver is the CUPS Raster driver \"hpcups\" and as alternative the\n   older IJS-based HPIJS driver is still available, but its development and\n   support has been discontinued. In addition there\n   are ready-made PPD files for all supported PostScript printers, so\n   that they get used in PostScript mode. HPLIP ships updated PPD\n   files for all HP printers and both driver flavors. Therefore we do\n   not provide PPD files here. For non-HP printers which work with\n   HPIJS we provide PPDs via the driver entries \"<a\n   href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs-pcl3\">hpijs-pcl3</a>\",\n   \"<a\n   href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs-pcl5e\">hpijs-pcl5e</a>\",\n   \"<a\n   href=\"show_driver.cgi?driver=hpijs-pcl5c\">hpijs-pcl5c</a>\".<P>",
